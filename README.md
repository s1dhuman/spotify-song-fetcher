# Spotify Random Song Fetcher ‼️🎵

A fun little side project that fetches a **random song** from one of my goated Spotify playlist and serves it as a live **SVG card**.

Built using the Spotify Web API and deployed on Vercel as a serverless function.

## 🔧 Tech Used 🤖
- Node.js
- Spotify Web API
- Vercel (Serverless Functions)
- SVG Rendering

## 🚀 Live Demo
Add this to your GitHub README to display a random song from the playlist every time your profile loads:

```
![Now Playing](https://spotify-song-fetcher.vercel.app/api/random-song)
```

Paste that into your `README.md` file and you’re all set!

Let me know if you want to auto-update the playlist, theme it, or show your top track instead — happy to help!
